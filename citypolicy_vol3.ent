macro:->Previous
studies
have
tried
to
address
some
of
these
questions
using
panel
data
on
policy
or
preferences
\citep
[see][]{einstein2016pushing,sances2017voters}.
However,
as
we
lay
out
below,
even
these
studies
are
not
able
to
adequately
capture
how
local
policy
responds
to
changes
in
citizen
preferences.

macro:->An
important
feature
of
the
system
is
that
the
pool
of
candidates
is
very
large.
In
the
latest
election
in
2017,
more
than
1/400
of
citizens
eligible
to
run
for
local
office
did
so.
The
combination
of
high
turnout,
a
proportional
electoral
system
and
large
candidate
pool
means
that
seats
are
contested,
and
voters
always
have
a
choice
between
many
different
candidates.
When
investigating
the
link
between
voting
behavior
and
fiscal
policy
in
other
settings,
this
might
have
been
a
problem
\citep
[see][]{suzuki2018does}.
See
Appendix
\ref
{context}
for
more
details
on
the
political
system
in
Danish
municipalities.

macro:->The
local
governments
are
responsible
for
providing
a
number
of
public
services,
such
as
nursing
homes
and
daycare
centers.
The
majority
of
the
cost
for
these
public
services
are
paid
by
the
municipalities,
but
they
are
allowed
to
set
a
co-payment
that
the
citizen
has
to
pay.
More
conservative
local
governments
are
thus
able
to
reduce
public
spending
by
increasing
these
co-pays.

macro:->We
arrive
at
these
estimates
by
using
the
correlation
between
each
item
and
the
overall
measure
of
fiscal
policy
conservatism.
The
full
list
of
correlations
is
presented
in
Appendix
\ref
{estimation}.

macro:->These
correspond
to
13
regional
governments
(\textit

which
were
responsible
for,
among
other
things,
health
care
in
the
period
we
study.

macro:->In
Appendix
\ref
{stability}
we
also
allow
the
effect
of
voter
preferences
on
policy
four
years
into
the
future
to
vary
across
time
by
including
random
slopes
by
year.
The
results
show
that
municipal
policy
responsiveness
is
highly
stable
throughout
our
period
of
study.
Preferences
do
not
seem
to
matter
more
or
less
as
time
goes
by.
